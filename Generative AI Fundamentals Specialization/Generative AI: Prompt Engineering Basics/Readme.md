Lesson Summary

At this point, you have learned the concepts of prompts and prompt engineering in generative AI. You have also explored the best practices for writing effective prompts and some common prompt engineering tools.

You learned the definition of prompts and their elements. You were introduced to prompt engineering and its relevance to generative AI models. You learned the best practices for writing effective prompts and how to refine them. You learned the functionalities and capabilities of common prompt engineering tools. You even got the opportunity to experience creating prompts and learning about naive prompting and persona patterns through hands-on lab experiences. You were privy to what experts from the field had to say about prompt engineering. 

Specifically, you learned that:

A prompt is any input or a series of instructions you provide to a generative model to produce a desired output.

These instructions help in directing the creativity of the model and assist it in producing relevant and logical responses. 

The building blocks of a well-structured prompt include instruction, context, input data, and output indicators. 

These elements help the model comprehend our necessities and generate relevant responses. 

Prompt engineering is designing effective prompts to leverage the full capabilities of the generative AI models in producing optimal responses.

Refining a prompt involves experimenting with various factors that could influence the output from the model.

Prompt engineering helps optimize model efficiency, boost performance, understand model constraints, and enhance its security.

Writing effective prompts is essential for supervising the style, tone, and content of output.

Best practices for writing effective prompts can be implemented across four dimensions: clarity, context, precision, and role-play.

Prompt engineering tools provide various features and functionalities to optimize prompts. 

Some of these functionalities include suggestions for prompts, contextual understanding, iterative refinement, bias mitigation, domain-specific aid, and libraries of predefined prompts. 

A few common tools and platforms for prompt engineering include IBM watsonx Prompt Lab, Spellbook, Dust, and PromptPerfect. 

# Prompt Engineering : Techniques and Approaches
Lesson Summary
Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. 

At this point, you have learned the techniques for skillfully crafting prompts that effectively steer generative AI models. You now know the various prompt engineering approaches that optimize the response of generative AI models.

You explored the techniques, including zero-shot and few-shot prompting, using which text prompts can improve the reliability of large language models (LLMs) and yield greater benefits from their responses. You learned how using different approaches such as interview patterns, Chain-of-Thought, and Tree-of-Thought to write prompts helps generative AI models produce more specific, contextual, and customized responses to the user's needs. You even had the opportunity to experience the application of each of these approaches through hands-on lab experiences. You were privy to what experts from the field had to say about the role of prompt engineering in AI.

Specifically, you learned that:

The various techniques using which text prompts can improve the reliability and quality of the output generated from LLMs are task specification, contextual guidance, domain expertise, bias mitigation, framing, and the user feedback loop. 

The zero-shot prompting technique refers to the capability of LLMs to generate meaningful responses to prompts without needing prior training.

The few-shot prompting technique used with LLMs relies on in-context learning, wherein demonstrations are provided in the prompt to steer the model toward better performance.

The several benefits of using text prompts with LLMs effectively are increasing the explain ability of LLMs, addressing ethical considerations, and building user trust. 

The interview pattern approach is superior to the conventional prompting approach as it allows a more dynamic and iterative conversation when interacting with generative AI models.

The Chain-of-Thought approach strengthens the cognitive abilities of generative AI models and solicits a step-by-step thinking process.

The Tree-of-Thought approach is an innovative technique that builds upon the Chain-of-Thought approach and involves structuring prompts hierarchically, akin to a tree, to guide the model's reasoning and output generation.
